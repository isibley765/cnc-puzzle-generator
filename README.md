# cnc-puzzle-generator
I wanted to make some puzzles for myself, partner, and friends, and thought a little python tool would go a long ways.  As of creation, the plan is to add a little randomized jitter! Feel free to use for your own DIY creations, or images/etc -- but if you get more creative (like a DND battle map of puzzle pieces), do share!
