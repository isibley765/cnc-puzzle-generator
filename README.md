# cnc-puzzle-generator
I wanted to make some puzzles for myself, partner, and friends, and thought a little python tool would go a long ways.  As of creation, the plan is to add a little randomized jitter! Feel free to use for your own DIY creations, or images/etc -- but if you get more creative (like a DND battle map of puzzle pieces), do share!

## Usage

Working on it!

I do recommend a `venv/` folder though, and do note that I'm presently working on Python 3.12.10.
Depending on when you see this repo, there may be more pip packages than I use in the end -- I'm trying out drawlib + mathplotlib to start, but we'll see where the journey takes us.

### Inspirations

Though I didn't fully parse the code, I did appreciate the vertical vs horizontal lines approach by [Draradech](https://github.com/Draradech) for JavaScript, and my first approach will likely follow suit.
